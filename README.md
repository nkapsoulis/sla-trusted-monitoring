# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

 Hyperledger mentership Wiki link: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/SLA+Self-Assessment+with+Hyperledger+Fabric 
 
# Release Notes

The project is part of LFX mentee 2022 (summer).

The Project file contain following tools for the SLA test case:

1. Hyperledger Fabric network implimentation.
2. Hypereldger Blockchain explorer https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-explorer
3. Hyperledgre Fabric Private chaincode implimenation inconjuction with fabric smart client.
4. Hyperledger Fabric Private chaincode sample video-demo is attached. https://youtu.be/THYoI56AMVQ 

# Quick start (using existing network)
 In this tutorial two organziation, use the SLA with each other using fabric smart client, a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network implimentation inside Fabric private chaine code (FPC) implimentation.

 Your role is different during the lifecycle of the SLA and you will act as a developer and administrator in both two organziation. You will be performing the following steps:

 1. Set up machine and download samples from repository
 2. Creation of the network
 3. Exploring the SLA smartcontract
 4. Deploy the smart contract to the channel by follwing the approving the chaincode definition as DelhiCloud and AryaSystem.
 5. Understand how organization uses the smartcontract in their application.

Note: This tutorial has been tested on Utuntu 20.04 LTS and may work on the other Linux distribution.

## Prerequisites:

You are expected to download the sample Hyperledger Fabric from the Github and install the prerequisite files as instructed in the folloiwng pages: 
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.3/install.html

### Interplanetary File System (IPFS) 
A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open. IPFS is a file sharing system that can be leveraged to more efficiently store and share large files. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain Learn more here: https://ipfs.tech/ (*this is for the added knowlege).

## Notes: To be careful while deploying setup
Specifically for the first time implimenation, use the specific version as mentioned in the documentaion (for easyness).

## Prerequisites for Fabric Private chaincode implimentation

Ensure that you have correctly installed and setup the $GOPATH and $GOROOT.

# Troubleshooting
### Error in network implimentation in FPC
Please go through the discord channel, few problem has been identified and discussed over there.

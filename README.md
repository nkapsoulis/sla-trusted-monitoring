# Release Notes

The project is part of LFX mentorship 2022 inside the Hyperledger foundation.

Hyperledger mentorship project Wiki link: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/SLA+Self-Assessment+with+Hyperledger+Fabric 
 
The Project was realized with the help of the following steps and implementation for the Service Level Agreement (SLA) test case:

1. Hyperledger Fabric network implementation.
2. Hypereldger Blockchain explorer https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-explorer
3. Hyperledgre Fabric Private chaincode implemenation in-conjuction with fabric smart client.

SLA test case implementation video-demo is attached and can be found inside the following link: https://github.com/singhravipratap/SLA/blob/a2a62d57f7f9d84f925636677a906323ec61bfda/video/link

# Quick start guide
 In SLA test case tutorial, two organizations in the Fabic network (fabric smart client), participate in Fabric private chaincode (FPC) implementation.

 The user role can be different either a developer or/and an administrator in both two organization. To implement the SLA test case, the following tasks need to be performed following below-mentioned steps:

 1. Set up the machine and download samples from the repository.
 2. Creation of the network.
 3. Exploring the SLA smartcontract.
 4. Deploy the smartcontract.
 5. Using the client terminal to interact with the network and perform the transaction.

Note: This tutorial has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Prerequisites:

You are expected to download the sample Hyperledger Fabric from Github and install prerequisite files as instructed in the following pages: 
1. Hyperledger Fabric:    https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.3/install.html
2. Hyperledger Fabric Private chaincode:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-private-chaincode/tree/go-support-preview 

## Start Hyperledger Fabric Private Chaincode network

### Notes: To be careful while deploying the setup
Use the specific version of tools as mentioned in the documentation (for easiness).

### Prerequisites for Fabric Private chaincode implementation
Ensure that you have correctly installed and set up the $GOPATH and $GOROOT.

## Troubleshooting
### Error in network implementation in FPC
Please go through the FPC discord channel, https://discord.com/invite/hyperledger. A few problems have been identified and discussed over there.

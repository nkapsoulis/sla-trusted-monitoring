# Service Level Agreement (SLA)


 Hyperledger Wiki link: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/SLA+Self-Assessment+with+Hyperledger+Fabric 
 
# Release Notes

The project is part of LFX mentee 2022 (summer).

The Project file contain following tools for the SLA test case:

1. Fabric network implimentation.
2. Hypereldger fabric explorer
3. Hyperledgre Fabric Private chaincode implimenation
4. Hypwerledger Fabric Private chaincode sampe demo is attached.

# Quick start (using existing network)
 In this tutorial two organziation, DelhiCloud and AryaSystem trade the SLA with each other using SlaNet, a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network implimentation.

 Your role is different during the lifecycle of the SLA and you will act as a developer and administrator in both two organziation. You will be performing the following steps:

 1. Set up machine and download samples from repository
 2. Creation of the network
 3. Exploring the SLA smart contract
 4. Deploy the smart contract to the channel by follwing the approving the chaincode definition as DelhiCloud and AryaSystem.
 5. Understand how DelhiCloud uses the smart contract in their application

Note: This tutorial has been tested on Utuntu and may work on the other Linux distribution.

## Prerequisites

You are expected to download the sample Hyperledger Fabric from the Github and install the prerequisite files as instructed in the folloiwng pages: 


### Interplanetary File System (IPFS) 
A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open. IPFS is a file sharing system that can be leveraged to more efficiently store and share large files. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain Learn more here: https://ipfs.tech/
